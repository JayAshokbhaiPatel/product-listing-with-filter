(Rename the script.jsx file to script.js. It is named jsx to avoid getting blocked by gmail)

- You are given starting code and a screen recording with the final expected UI in this zip.
- You are given an array of products in the JavaScript file. You have to render product cards based on that. DONE
- Do not hard code the cards in HTML. Instead, use JavaScript to render them from the array. DONE
- Changing the value of select in the header should also apply a filter to the product list.
- Products that are on sale also have the sale price. Which should be shown in the card. DONE
- The product cards are responsive, and the alignment of the contents of the cards is changed based on available space. DONE
- Clicking on the add to cart button should show a window alert saying the product was added to the cart. DONE
- Once done, make a zip of your final code and send it over.

## All the best!!!
